# Get started

1. Clone or download this repository by pressing the green button (you will find the button above the list of my files which is shown above this section on this page) with the text "Clone or download".

2. Then choose if you want to download a ZIP containing the repository, or copy the URL (shown when pressing the button) and use it in your terminal to clone the repository locally.

3. Once you've got the repo on your computer, open it in the terminal and run "npm install" (in the root directory of the project).

4. [Follow this guide](https://socketcluster.io/#!/docs/getting-started) to setup a socketCluster (socket server) instance in this project. Follow until the section "Serving SocketCluster" begins.

5. Now it's time to spin up the socket server to retrieve some nice real time data. To achieve this, you need to cd into the socket directory (named "myApp" in the guide above) and run "node server.js".

6. Now let's jump back into the root directory of the project and run npm start to run the application. And that should be it!
